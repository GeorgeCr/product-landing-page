<h1>This is a project done for the Free Code Camp Project tasks available and consists of a basic landing page for an imaginary Keyboard producer</h1>
<h2>I used the following technologies: html, css/sass, npm(for compiling the sass code and live-server feature)</h2>
<h3> I got stuck at the responsive part, as I didn't do the mobile first aproach. I will update asap </h3>
